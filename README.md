Python Programming Developer Internship at Main Flow Services and Technologies 

Introduction: Welcome to my GitHub repository documenting my journey as a Python Programming Developer intern at Main Flow Services and Technologies! In this repository, I'll be sharing my learnings, projects, and experiences throughout the internship.

Internship Highlights: Learning Python and Data Analysis: Sharpening my Python analyze data efficiently and derive valuable insights. Hands-on Projects: Working on real-world projects to apply theoretical knowledge and gain practical experience. Collaborative Environment: Engaging with a talented team of professionals and learning from their expertise.


Task 1: Understanding Basic Data Structures
Description: This task involves understanding the basic data types in Python such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.
Responsibility: Wrote a Python program to create a list, a dictionary, and a set, that can perform basic operations like adding, removing, and modifying elements.


Task 2: Data Manipulation with Pandas
Description: This task involves using the Pandas library to manipulate data.
Responsibility: Loaded a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and performed operations like filtering data based on conditions, handling missing values, and calculating summary statistics.

Task3:web scraping using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup
Description: The intern will create a basic web scraper using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup.
Responsibility: 1. Follow tutorials to understand web scraping principles and techniques.
2. Develop a simple Python script to scrape data from a static web page.
3. Extract relevant information such as text, links, or images from web pages

Task4: Description: The intern will build a simple command-line calculator application in Python.
Responsibility:
1. Design the user interface for the calculator using Python's input function.
2. Implement functions for basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. Handle user input validation to ensure the calculator behaves predictably.

Task5:
Description:
Develop a USD currency converter application with a graphical userinterface (GUI) in Python. The application will allow users to input anamount in USD and convert it to various other currencies based on the
latest exchange rates. The application should be easy to use and provide accurate, up-to-date conversion rates.
Responsibility: 1. Environment Setup:
• Install Python and necessary libraries (e.g., Tkinter for GUI, requests for API calls).
2. Currency Conversion Logic:
• Implement the logic to convert USD to selected currencies using the fetched exchange rates.
• Ensure accurate calculations and handle edge cases (e.g., very large or small amounts).
3. GUI Design and Development:
• Design the layout of the application using Tkinter or any other Python GUI framework. 
• Create input fields for the USD amount and dropdown menus for selecting
